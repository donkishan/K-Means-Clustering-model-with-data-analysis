# K-Means-Clustering-model-with-data-analysis
This project, developed by Kishan H S, applies K-means Clustering to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of this project is to group similar data points in the dataset and analyze whether the unsupervised clusters correlate with the diagnosis of breast cancer (malignant or benign). Although clustering is an unsupervised learning method, this project explores the effectiveness of K-means clustering in identifying patterns in the data and how well the clusters align with actual diagnoses.
